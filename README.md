## Getting Started

### Requirements
* Please make sure you have NodeJS installed, as this contains `npm`, which is necessary
for installing dependencies, starting the appropriate scripts, and building your web project.

### Quick Start
Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/shaminmeerankutty/webpack-sass-bootstrap-boilerplate.git

Navigate to the project folder:

    cd webpack-sass-bootstrap-boilerplate

Install all packages and dependencies required for this project:

    npm install
    
Start the development environment (then, navigate to http://localhost:8080):

    npm start
 
Then, open a browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8080/ 
    
Building files can be done as follows:

    npm run build

### How To Use
* Add your HTML files by inserting or including them in the `src` directory (By default `index.html` is added to your `src` directory, feel free to edit it and 
experiment with the changes live.)
    
    * Make sure you restart development server after adding new HTML files

* Add images to your `src/assets` folder.
* Add sass (SCSS) files to `src/scss` folder.
  * Make sure you import the scss file in `main.scss` 
    
```sass
    @import "filename";
```
